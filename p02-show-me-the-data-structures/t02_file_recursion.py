"""
File Recursion

Problem Statement
Write code for finding all files under a directory
and all directories beneath it that end with ".c"

Find all files beneath path with file name suffix.

Note that a path may contain further subdirectories
and those subdirectories may also contain further subdirectories.

There are no limit to the depth of the subdirectories can be.

Args:
    suffix(str): suffix if the file name to be found
    path(str): path of the file system

Returns:
    a list of paths


Python's os module will be usefulâ€”in particular, you can use:
os.path.isdir(path)
os.path.isfile(path)
os.listdir(directory)
os.path.join(...)

Note: os.walk() is a handy Python method which can achieve this task
very easily. However, for this problem you are not allowed to use os.walk().


Solution:
List the files in the present directory.
If an entry ends with the given suffix, add it to the output list.
If an entry is directory, call the function recursively
to get files in that directory.

Complexity Analysis:
n = total number of files/directories in the given path.

TC: O(n)
SC: O(n)
