Task 1: LRU Cache
Solution Logic:
Use python dictionary which works as map data structure
to keep the (key, value) pair in the cache.

Maintain a variable to keep track of the last key.
If the max cache size is reached, pop that key from the cache.

Solution Time Complexity:
Set: O(1)
Get: O(1)
Pop: O(1)

Reason: Set, get, and pop operations in python dictionary takes constant time.
During the removal of the oldest key, we are just performing the pop operation.
