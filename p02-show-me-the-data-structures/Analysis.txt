Task 1: LRU Cache
Solution Logic:
Use python dictionary which works as map data structure
to keep the (key, value) pair in the cache.

Maintain a variable to keep track of the last key.
If the max cache size is reached, pop that key from the cache.

Solution Time Complexity:
Set: O(1)
Get: O(1)
Pop: O(1)

Reason: Set, get, and pop operations in python dictionary takes constant time.
During the removal of the oldest key, we are just performing the pop operation.


Task 2: File Recursion
Solution:
List the files in the present directory.
If an entry ends with the given suffix, add it to the output list.
If an entry is directory, call the function recursively
to get files in that directory.

Complexity Analysis:
n = total number of files/directories in the given path.

TC: O(n)
SC: O(n)
