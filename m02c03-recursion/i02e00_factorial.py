Factorial using recursion
The factorial function is a mathematical function that multiplies a given
number, n, and all of the whole numbers from n down to 1.

For example, if n is 4 then we will get:
4∗3∗2∗1 = 24

This is often notated using an exclamation point, as in 4!

So  4! = 4∗3∗2∗1 = 24
More generally, we can say that for any input  n :

n! = n∗(n−1)∗(n−2)...1
If you look at this more closely, you will find that the factorial of
any number is the product of that number and the factorial of the next
smallest number. In other words:

n! = n∗(n−1)!
Notice that this is recursive, meaning that we can solve for the factorial of
any given number by first solving for the factorial of the next smallest
number, and the next smallest number, and the next smallest number, and so on,
until we reach 1.

If you were to write a Python function called factorial to calculate the
factorial of a number, then we could restate what we said above as follows:
factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)

So that is the goal of this exercise: To use recursion to write a function
that will take a number and return the factorial of that number.

For example, you should be able to call your function with factorial(4)
and get back 24.

Note: By definition,  0!=1
