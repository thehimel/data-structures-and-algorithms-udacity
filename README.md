# Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree - Udacity

##About the Nanodegree Program
In this Nanodegree program, I have learned various Data Strutures and Algorithms in Computer Science. For each topic, I have solved the given problem that gave me an in-depth knowledge of the concept. I solved 100+ DS and Algorithmic problems and it was quite fun to code in Python.

## Technologies and Tools
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash
