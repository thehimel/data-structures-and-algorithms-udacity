# Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree - Udacity

##About the Nanodegree Program
In this Nanodegree program, I have learned various Data Strutures and Algorithms in Computer Science. For each topic, I have solved the given problem that gave me an in-depth knowledge of the concept. I solved 100+ DS and Algorithmic problems and it was quite fun to code in Python.

## Projects
### Project 1. Unscramble Computer Science Problems
#### About
Deconstruct a series of open-ended problems into smaller components (e.g., inputs, output, series of functions).

#### Task 1
Given the data of calls and text messages of a telemarketing company.
What is the first record of texts and what is the last record of calls?

#### Task 2
How many different telephone numbers are there in the records?

#### Task 3
Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period? Don't forget that time spent answering a call is also time spent on the phone.

#### Task 4
- Part 1. Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
in Bangalore.
- Part 2. What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
to fixed lines also in Bangalore?

#### Task 5
The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers:
- These numbers make outgoing calls.
- Never send texts, receive texts or receive incoming calls.

#### Task 6

### Project 2. Show Me the Data Structures
#### About
Solve a series if open-ended practice problems. Hone your skills to identify and implement appropriate data structures and corresponding methods that meet given constraints.

#### Task 1. Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache.
Use an appropriate data structure(s) to implement the LRU cache.
- In case of a cache hit, your get() operation should return the value.
- In case of a cache miss, your get() should return -1.
- While putting an element in the cache, your put() / set() operation must insert the element. If the cache is full, you must write code that removes the least recently used entry first  and then insert the element.
- All operations must take O(1) time.

#### Taks 2. File Recursion
Write code for finding all files under a directory and all directories beneath it that end with ".c". Find all files beneath path with file name suffix.

#### Task 3. Huffman Algorithm
Implement Huffman Encoding and Decoding for data compression.

#### Task 4. Active Directory
In context of groups and users in Windows OS, users can be part of a group and one group can also be a part of another group. In that case all users of child group becomes the users of parent group. If the username/id and group passed as input parameters, return True/False whether the user is part of that group or not. In the place of username/id, a child group name can also be passed.

#### Task 5. Blockchain
A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.

#### Task 6. Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Implement the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B, A ∪ B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all elements that are members of both the sets A and B.

You will take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively.
