# Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree - Udacity

##About the Nanodegree Program
In this Nanodegree program, I have learned various Data Strutures and Algorithms in Computer Science. For each topic, I have solved the given problem that gave me an in-depth knowledge of the concept. I solved 100+ DS and Algorithmic problems and it was quite fun to code in Python.

## Technologies and Tools
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash

## Projects
### Project 1. Unscramble Computer Science Problems
#### About
Deconstruct a series of open-ended problems into smaller components (e.g., inputs, output, series of functions).

#### Task 1
Given the data of calls and text messages of a telemarketing company.
What is the first record of texts and what is the last record of calls?

#### Task 2
How many different telephone numbers are there in the records?

#### Task 3
Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period? Don't forget that time spent answering a call is also time spent on the phone.

#### Task 4
- Part 1. Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
in Bangalore.
- Part 2. What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
to fixed lines also in Bangalore?

#### Task 5
The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing telephone marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers:
- These numbers make outgoing calls.
- Never send texts, receive texts or receive incoming calls.

#### Task 6
