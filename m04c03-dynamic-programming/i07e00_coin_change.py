Coin Change

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.
Write a function to compute the fewest coins needed to make up that amount.
If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins,
return -1.

As an example:
Input: coins = [1, 2, 3], amount = 6
Output: 2

Explanation: The output is 2 because we can use 2 coins with value 3.
That is, 6 = 3 + 3. We could also use 3 coins with value 2
(that is, 6 = 2 + 2 + 2), but this would use more coinsâ€”and the problem
specifies we should use the smallest number of coins possible.


Solution Two
- We initiate F[Amount] to be float('inf') and F[0] = 0

- Let F[Amount] to be the min number of coins needed to get the Amount.

- If F[Amount] is reachable,
F[Amount + coin] = min(F(Amount + coin), F(Amount) + 1).

- If F[Amount] is not reachable, F[Amount + coin] = F(Amount + coin).

Complexity Analysis:
C = Number of coins
A = Amount

TC: O(C^A) -> O(n^2)
SC: O(A) -> O(n)

TC: O(n^2)
SC: O(n)
